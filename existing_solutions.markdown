## Summary
Existing tools like Zillow, Redfin, NeighborhoodScout, and StreetEasy excel at providing real estate listings and basic neighborhood data but fall short in personalized lifestyle-based matching.

- Using free NYC Open Data to integrate safety, affordability, walkability, and transit metrics.
- Implementing a weighted scoring algorithm to match neighborhoods to user preferences.
- Offering a free, accessible web application tailored to NYC.
