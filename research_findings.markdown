# NeighborFit User Research Findings

## Synthesized Findings
Based on freely available information from web articles, Reddit discussions (e.g., r/AskNYC), and NYC Open Data dataset descriptions:
- **Demographics**:
  - Young professionals (25–34) prioritize vibrant, walkable neighborhoods with good transit access (e.g., Lower East Side, Williamsburg).
  - Families prioritize safety and affordability, often choosing neighborhoods like Forest Hills or Bay Ridge.
  - Students seek affordable areas near universities or transit hubs (e.g., Morningside Heights).
- **Preferences**:
  - **Safety**: Frequently cited as a top concern due to varying crime rates across NYC neighborhoods (e.g., r/AskNYC posts highlight safety in Brooklyn vs. Manhattan).
  - **Affordability**: Critical due to NYC’s high cost of living; median rents are a key decision factor (e.g., articles note rent as a barrier for young professionals).
  - **Walkability**: Valued by urban dwellers for access to amenities like restaurants, parks, and shops (e.g., Manhattan neighborhoods score high on walkability).
  - **Transit Access**: Essential in NYC, where many rely on subways and buses (e.g., discussions emphasize proximity to MTA stations).
- **Pain Points with Existing Tools**:
  - Tools like Zillow focus on listings, not lifestyle matching.
  - Lack of integration between safety, affordability, and amenity data.

## Hypotheses
Based on synthesized insights, we propose the following hypotheses:
1. **Hypothesis 1**: Young professionals in NYC prioritize walkability and transit access over affordability due to reliance on public transportation and desire for vibrant neighborhoods.
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Families in NYC prioritize safety and affordability over walkability due to concerns about crime and high housing costs.
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Users find existing tools like Zillow inadequate because they focus on real estate listings rather than personalized lifestyle matching.

  - **Survey**: Not conducted due to constraints; findings based on freely available online sources.
  - **Interviews**: Simulated based on synthesized insights from web articles, Reddit (r/nyc, r/AskNYC), and NYC Open Data dataset descriptions.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Validate hypotheses using NYC Open Data (e.g., crime rates, housing costs, amenity proximity) in the data analysis phase.
  - Incorporate findings into algorithm design to prioritize user-preferred metrics.
