# NeighborFit Problem Definition

## Problem Statement
NeighborFit is a web application that helps users find neighborhoods matching their lifestyle preferences (e.g., safety, affordability, walkability) by processing real-world data and using a weighted scoring algorithm to recommend the best matches.

## User Needs
The application will focus on the following user preferences:
1. **Safety**: Low crime rates, based on publicly available crime data.
2. **Affordability**: Reasonable cost of living, measured by median rent or housing prices.
3. **Walkability**: Access to amenities like parks, restaurants, and shops, measured by walkability scores or proximity data.
4. **Transit Access**: Availability of public transportation, measured by transit scores or proximity to transit stops.

## Scope
- The application will use free data sources to collect real neighborhood data.
- It will provide a simple interface for users to input preferences and view ranked neighborhood recommendations.
- The initial implementation will focus on a single city (e.g., New York City) to manage data complexity within the 2-week timeline.
